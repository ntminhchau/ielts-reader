      "title": "Section 1: Transition Care for the Elderly",
      "passage": "Transition care is for older people who have been receiving medical treatment, but need more help to recover, and time to make a decision about the best place for them to live in the longer term. You can only access transition care directly from the hospital.\n\nTransition care is focused on individual goals and therapies and is given for a limited time only. It offers access to a package of services that may include:\n\n• low-intensity therapy such as physiotherapy (exercise, mobility, strength and balance) and podiatry (foot care)\n• access to a social worker\n• nursing support for clinical care such as wound care\n• personal care\n\nTransition care is often provided by non-government organisations and is subsidised by the government. If your circumstances allow, it is expected you’ll contribute to the cost of your care.\n\nDaily care fees are set by the organisation that provides your transition care services (your service provider). They should explain these fees to you, and the amount charged should form part of the agreement between you and the service provider. The fee is calculated on a daily basis.\n\nTransition care is provided in your own home or in a ‘live-in’ setting. This setting can be part of an existing aged-care home or health facility such as a separate wing of a hospital.\n\nIf you’re already receiving subsidised residential care in an aged-care home, but you need to go somewhere else for transition care, your place in the aged-care home will be held until you return.",
