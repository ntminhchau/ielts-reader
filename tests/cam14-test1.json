      "title": "Section 1 - Transition Care for the Elderly",
      "passage": "Transition care is for older people who have been in hospital. It helps them return home rather than go into residential care.\n\nTransition care offers short-term support and active management for older people at the end of a hospital stay. It provides goal-oriented, time-limited and therapy-focused care. Transition care is not ongoing care.\n\nThe program is for older people who need more time and support before they are ready to go home. It can be delivered in the person’s home or in a residential care setting.\n\nTo be eligible for transition care, the person must be a hospital inpatient and be assessed as eligible by the Aged Care Assessment Team (ACAT) while in hospital.\n\nTransition care is focused on individual goals and therapies and may include physiotherapy, occupational therapy, social work and nursing support. The care is designed to help the person recover and become as independent as possible.\n\nThe program can last for up to 12 weeks. In some cases, it may be extended by another six weeks. Fees may apply, and they are based on the person’s income.",
