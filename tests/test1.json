  "passage": "The history of coffee is as rich as its flavor. Originating in Ethiopia, coffee spread to the Arabian Peninsula and then to Europe. By the 17th century, coffeehouses had become cultural hubs in England. Over time, coffee production shifted to colonies with suitable climates, such as those in South America and Southeast Asia.\n\nThe coffee trade has influenced global economics, fueled revolutions, and even shaped modern work culture. Its popularity is rivaled only by tea and water. As coffee continues to evolve, from traditional brews to specialty blends, it remains central to millions of lives daily.",
